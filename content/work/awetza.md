Awetza is a community demographics database, developed and maintained by LTF under
commision of Fourwinds and Associates. Awetza enables communities to track powerful
statistics and metrics for leadership. Awetza tracks funding, costs, and success 
rate of programs. Awetza enables automatic upload to ISETS. 
Awetza's powerful reporting can be used by leadership for data-driven governance.

All information is community owned and controlled. Data can be updated, added, or
deleted at any time. Information collected is tailored to community needs. We understand
that the right of Aboriginal communities to own, control, access, and possess information
about their people is fundamentally tied to self-determination and to the preservation and
development of their culture.
