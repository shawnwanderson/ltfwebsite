Melange is an automated trading platform that uses Machine Learning
to forecast cryptocurrency price changes. Forecasts are used for high frequency
portfolio optimization. Necesarry trades are computed and executed by portfolio
re-allocating and rebalancing software on exchanges.

Melange can easily be applied to any account holding funds on common cryptocurrency
exchanges such as Binance or Kraken. This process can be achieved without transfering 
control of coins. All that is needed is a trade-enabled API key.
